# odin-recipes
The Odin-Recipes project features a home page that links to 3 recipes: lasagna, potato salad, and cake. 

User experience: Upon arriving on the home page, when the user clicks on any of the three recipe links, a new page is opened. This page contains a brief description of the recipe, an image of the final product, unordered list of ingredients, and ordered list of steps for preparing the recipe.

Skills learnt:
-Boilerplate code.
-Placing anchor tag + list to link homepage to recipes and back.
-Creating subpages with link, images, headings, ordered lists, and unordered lists.
